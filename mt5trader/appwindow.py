"""Open the terminal in a window of its own, not a browser tab.

The trader double-clicks an icon and the terminal is there. No address
bar, no tab strip, no bookmark to a port that changed — and, more to the
point on a screen that sends live orders:

- **A tab can be closed by accident.** An app window has one thing in
  it, and closing it is a deliberate act rather than a stray ctrl-W
  aimed at the tab beside it.
- **Extensions do not run here.** `--user-data-dir` puts this window in
  a profile of its own, so whatever is installed in the trader's normal
  browsing profile — ad blockers, script injectors, a password manager
  that autofills the wrong form — is simply not present in the process
  showing the order entry screen.
- **The chrome is vertical space.** A tab strip and an address bar are
  about 70px, and this desk has spent real effort on rail height.

Edge is used because it is on every Windows 10 and 11 machine, so
nothing extra ships and there is no new build toolchain. Chrome takes
the identical flags and is tried next. If neither is found the ordinary
browser is opened instead and the trader is told why the window looks
different — a missing app window must never mean a missing terminal.
