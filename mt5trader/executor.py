"""Getting a pair ON, and getting it OFF again.

This module owns the two dangerous moments in the product: the naked
window between one leg being on and the other landing, and the close
that must target a position TICKET because these accounts are hedging
mode.

MARKET mode only lives here for now (spec §14: get flat-and-back-to-flat
exactly right before anything rests). The LIMIT path reuses everything
below it — the hedge arithmetic, the deadline, the unwind, the
ticket-based closes — and differs only in how the first leg gets on.

Three rules, each of which cost money in the system this is ported
from:

1. **The crossing order goes IMMEDIATELY on fill — not after a wait.**
   `LEG_DEADLINE_SEC` is a failure-ESCALATION window, not a patience
   window. A market order round-trips in ~24ms; 2.0s is ~80x headroom
   and only fires on a real fault.
2. **Only a REJECTED crossing leg unwinds.** Slow is not rejected.
3. **The unwind CLOSES, it does not offset.** A plain opposite market
   order on a hedging account opens a SECOND position; that has already
   happened live, and the reconciler found both 60 seconds later.
