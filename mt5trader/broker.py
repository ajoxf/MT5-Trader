"""Broker session: the only module that touches the MetaTrader5 package.

HARD CONSTRAINT: the MetaTrader5 Python package holds ONE global
connection per process. Initializing a second session replaces the
first. True simultaneous streaming from two accounts therefore
requires one process per account plus a coordinator — which is why
this product runs one leg runner per account (see the spec, section 1).
This class makes the connection explicit (path/login/server from
config) so each such process can be pointed at its own terminal.

Ported from the stat-arb system, where every quirk in here was paid
for on a live account: 10015 invalid price, the filling-mode bitmask,
10027 AutoTrading disabled, deal history lagging positions_get, re-peg
by MODIFY rather than cancel-and-replace, and closes that target a
position TICKET because these accounts are hedging mode.
