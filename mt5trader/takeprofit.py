"""The exit price: break-even, and break-even plus a target.

A trader clicking a spread wants one number back immediately — where do
I get out? — and it is not a matter of taste. It is arithmetic on
figures this system already has:

- **Break-even** is the level the OTHER side of the book must reach for
  the trade to be worth nothing. Entering long means lifting the offer
  and leaving on the bid, so the round turn of both legs' bid-ask is
  already inside the two prices being compared; what is left to recover
  is COMMISSION, both legs, both ends.
- **The target** is a percentage of the MARGIN the position ties up.
  Margin is what the trade actually costs to hold, and it is per
  account and per broker — so it is read from the terminals with
  `order_calc_margin` rather than guessed from notional.

Money becomes spread points through `k` — `spread_units x quantity`,
the one multiplier every conversion in this system uses. There is no
second one here.

Two rules kept from everywhere else:

- **Unmeasured is not zero.** No margin figure from the terminals, or
  no `k`, means no target: the box shows an em dash and says what is
  missing. A TP of 0.00 would read as "get out at break-even", which is
  a different instruction.
- **Nothing here places an order.** It is a price on the screen. No
  bracket is sent to the broker, nothing exits by itself, and a leg
  never carries a broker-side stop (spec §4).
