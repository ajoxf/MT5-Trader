"""Qty is the lots, and the trader types both legs.

The desk's own words, 2026-09-03:

    Leg A is Gold, Leg B is Gold Future. When 1 lot is placed on the
    ladder it should place 1 lot of Leg A and 1 lot of Leg B. The
    system picks up the contract size from MT5 (say 100oz). A Qty of 1
    lot would be 1 x 100 oz on each leg. A Qty of 100 lots would be
    100 x 100 oz on each leg.

    Ignore the concept of notional value and remove it from the
    settings.

So `clip_lots_a` and `clip_lots_b` are what ONE unit of Qty is on each
leg, both typed, both defaulting to 1. Leg B is no longer derived from
anything, and the three sizing bases that used to derive it — the units
hedge, lot for lot, by notional — are gone.

This file is the end-to-end proof: what is typed is what the two
brokers receive, on a click and on a fill, and nothing in between
recomputes it.
