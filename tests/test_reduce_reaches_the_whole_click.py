"""A reduce must cover the WHOLE click, or it is not a reduce.

Live 2026-09-03, short 1207 spreads on the oil differential, BUY 100
clicked on the ladder:

    resting at 7.69 to CLOSE 2 position(s), then open 93

Two old tickets of 5 and 2 fitted inside the click; the 1,200 behind
them did not. `positions_to_reduce` took whole tickets only and STOPPED
at the first one too big, so 93 of the trader's 100 went the other way
— opening longs against their own short instead of covering it.

That is the failure "reduce before you open" exists to prevent. It had
not come back; it had moved from the SIDE to the SIZE, where the same
rule was not being applied.

The fix is to take the oldest ticket in PART. Everything a part-close
needs was already there — `close_position` sends pro-rata volumes,
`_closed_fraction` measures what actually came off, `reduce_by` leaves
the position open for the rest — and nothing was using it.
