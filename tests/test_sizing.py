"""What one Qty means on each leg — now that the trader types both.

QTY IS THE LOTS. `clip_lots_a` and `clip_lots_b` are what ONE unit of
the Qty box is on each leg, and both are typed: at 1 and 1 a Qty of 100
is 100 lots of leg A against 100 of leg B; at 1 and 2 it is 100 against
200. Nothing is derived and nothing is matched on the desk's behalf.

The hedge arithmetic that used to compute leg B is gone with it, and so
is the guarantee it bought. `k = L_B x C_B` still prices every
spread-to-money conversion, and a move gives exactly `-dS x k` only
when `L_A x C_A = beta x L_B x C_B`. Typed lots are under no obligation
to satisfy that. The tests that pinned the derivation are therefore
gone too; what is pinned here is that the typed numbers are the ones
that reach the brokers, unchanged except by each broker's own step.
